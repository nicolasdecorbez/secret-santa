# `secret-santa` : Manage your Secret Santa with a CLI :santa:

This project was born back in 2021, when I was organizing a Secret Santa with by best freinds. I coded a small and trival script to make random pairs of peoples, and to send them a email automatically, to preserve the surprise.

After that, I decided to improve it for the next christmas ; and maybe you would be interested to manage your Secret Santa with your terminal, who knows ? 

This is still a serious work-in-progress projects, I am still refactoring methods to register people / specing on how to interact with the code.
